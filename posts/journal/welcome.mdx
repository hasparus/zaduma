Iâ€™ve previously built two websites that I was pretty happy with :)

As I learned more about design and coding, I realized that it was better to start from scratch instead of refactoring.

This is the _fourth attempt_ to do so in the past 18 months. Scope creep kept becoming a big problemâ€¦.so I am taking it back to basics.

## **Why This Form?**

Thereâ€™s a ton of nice ways to build websites. While Framer, Squarespace and Webflow have grown substantially and are easy to use, there were two major problems:

1. I did not want to shell out an annual or monthly amount for any website.
2. Being more design focused meant that I kept layering things on when I have neither the design or coding chops to really make my vision come to reality.

And thereâ€™s where Astro comes in. You can scour the net for why everyone (including me) is excited for it.

I went from the old tried and trusted Bootstrap system to figuring things out in Gatsby and Hugo. Somehow, none of those ever felt right. Astro did, as did Tailwind and SolidJS.

I then scoured the internet for some templates and idea of how people approached development with Astro. I then happened on upon this [nice template](https://github.com/hasparus/zaduma).

Also there a couple of integrations that proved useful. But you can check those out in the link above.

Some further research revealed that many folks now have the text is centred because we generally assume that the eyes look at the middle of any screen. Or maybe I am just very late to the party.

There were also some modifications:

## **Removed**

### **Shiki Twoslash**
I wonâ€™t be sharing any code snippets hereâ€¦so it went the way of the dodo.

## **Introduced**

### **Streams**
This is essentially microblogging. I took cues from Twitter and every /stream of consciousness/ is limited to 240 characters. As a bonus, the latest one is always displayed on the main page.

These could be random thoughts or a quote Iâ€™ve liked and decided to share.

### **Footnotes**
Self-explanatory by way of  [littlefoot.js](https://littlefoot.js.org/). [It looks like this](https://littlefoot.js.org/assets/littlefoot-demo.gif) in motion, and I know Markdown has built-in support for footnotesâ€¦but sometimes you wanna go fancy.[^1]

### **PhotoSwipe**
A [nice JS library](https://photoswipe.com/) for photo galleries. Iâ€™ll use it at some point.

### **Plyr**
A [lightweight media player](https://plyr.io/). Also will be used at some point.

### **Footer**
It has a small copyright thingy with an automatically updating year. It also has the current time based on your system time.

## **Miscellaneous**

I deployed the site with Netlify as opposed to Vercel. I just like the former better.
