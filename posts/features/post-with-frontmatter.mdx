Imagine that this post was written a long time in the past in a paper notebook,
and then republished here. That's why we pass the `date` in `frontmatter`
instead of computing it from Git history.

Notice too, that the title isn't just the file name transformed into title case.
It's a handwritten, artisan title, optimized for SEO and sprinkled with
awesomeness.

Better read [./minimal-note](./minimal-note).
